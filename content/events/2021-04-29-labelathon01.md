We’re following up our Community Call [Set Up Your Package To Foster A Community](/commcalls/apr2021-pkg-community/) with an experiment!

Join us for 1.5 hours Thursday, April 29, 9 AM Pacific / 16:00 UTC for our first co-working “label-athon”.

- Meet other package developers and rOpenSci staff in Zoom
- Work independently, implementing some of our recommendations for your own package
- Get answers to your questions

At the end of the session we’ll tweet links to your “help wanted” issues to help you get attention to your project.

Our experiment includes 4 label-athons (if y’all show up, we can do more) at alternating times to accommodate our community around the world. Thursdays April 29, May 13, May 27, June 10.

[Registration](https://form.jotform.com/210906095013043) is encouraged.
