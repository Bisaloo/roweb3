In a year where it has felt insensitive to ask people to pay attention to anything that's not critical to their day-job, you have continued to share your time, expertise, enthusiasm, and willingness to try things with us. Our [staff team](/about/#team) of developers, researchers, and community builders work to build technical and social infrastructure to lower barriers to working with research data. Our community continually helps us raise the bar.

On behalf of rOpenSci, thank you. 

People have submitted their R packages for software peer review (16 package authors)[^1], reviewed those packages (**~XX** reviewers), contributed code or documentation (84 people made their first code contribution to rOpenSci this year), authored a [blog post or tech note](/archive/) (43 community member authors, including 21 first-time authors), shared a [use case](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/usecases/) to help package authors see how their work is being used and help other users imagine how they can apply it (42 people), attended a [Community Call](/commcalls/) (136 people in 19 countries), cited our software (380 citations of 132 packages), asked or answered questions, commented on project ideas, added notes to a public doc, or gave us a shoutout in a talk, a post, or on Twitter.
