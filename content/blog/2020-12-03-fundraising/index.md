rOpenSci fosters a culture that values open and reproducible research using shared data and reusable software. Our community in collaboration with our staff produce and maintain a vast collection of free open source software to support and accelerate scientific discovery. Something about community from the guide.

If you're giving this season, please consider [donating to rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/donate/) Tax receipt etc. 

The rOpenSci project is 100% supported by grants and donations. Your donations allow us to support internships, contractors, web services, and community events. Donations made by Dec 31 will result in matching funds to NumFOCUS, our fiscal sponsor.

rOpenSci is a Sponsored Project of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity in the United States. NumFOCUS provides rOpenSci with fiscal, legal, and administrative support to help ensure the health and sustainability of the project. Visit numfocus.org for more information.
