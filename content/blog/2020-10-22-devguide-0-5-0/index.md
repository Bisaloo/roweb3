rOpenSci Software Peer Review's guidance has been compiled in [an online book](https://devguide.ropensci.org/) for more than one year now. We've just released its fifth version.

## Guidance for testing

The updates feature two small but useful changes to our testing guidance.

Then, the chapter about package evolution (your reference if you are thinking about deprecating functions!) now includes guidance about testing deprecated functions. 
Thanks [Scott Chamberlain](/author/scott-chamberlain) for the contribution, and thanks to [Jindra Lacko](https://www.jla-data.net/) and [John Blischak](https://jdblischak.com/) for [their discussion on RStudio community forum](https://community.rstudio.com/t/unit-testing-of-a-deprecated-function/42837/) that inspired this addition.

First of all, we updated our [continuous integration guidance](https://devguide.ropensci.org/ci.html#whichci) by making GitHub Actions come first, as it seems to be gaining popularity. Thanks to [Luke McGuinness](https://github.com/mcguinlu) for initiating the discussion and to [Hugo Gruson](https://github.com/bisaloo) for sharing his insights.

## A reference to rOpenSci other best guide :wink:

Our guide featured a quite light chapter about [Contributing to rOpenSci](https://devguide.ropensci.org/contributingguide.html).
Now that rOpenSci Community Manager Stefanie Butland and Community Assistant Steffi LaZerte have written a whole guide about this topic, the chapter has been transformed into a teaser for it!

It is the opportunity for us to congratulate Stefanie and Steffi on the contributing guide, and to encourage you to read it.
Here's to many more versions. :grin:
