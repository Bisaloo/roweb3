> ¡Estamos muy felices de lanzar nuestro programa de Campeones y Campeonas!


## Porqué un programa de Campeones y Campeonas?

Estos programas se diseñan para identificar, reconocer y premiar a miembros apasionados de nuestras comunidades. 

En rOpenSci, reconocemos que existe una consternadora falta de diversidad en el ecosistema de las comunidades de software de investigación y de código abierto. La Comunidad R no es una excepción; las personas que realizan el desarrollo de software son abrumadoramente blancas, hombres y de un puñado de países. Esta decepcionante falta de diversidad es potencialmente perjudicial para la sostenibilidad, la utilidad y la productividad de los proyectos.  

We also know that communities of practice can drive meaningful change. We understand the importance of supporting a diverse cohort of community leaders and contributors to all aspects of research software creation as they strive to transform our ecosystem for the better.

The rOpenSci Champion Program [is part of a series of activities and projects we are carrying out to ensure our research software serves everyone in our communities](/blog/2021/12/20/inclusive-leadership-program/), which means that it needs to be sustainable and open, and built __by and for all groups.__

That is why this program focuses on __people who belong to groups that are historically and systematically excluded__ from the open software and research software communities and who are interested in contributing to rOpenSci and the broader open source and research software communities.

## What is our champions program?

We have developed a **12-month-long program including cohort-based training, project development, and personal mentorship**. 

Champions will participate in a 6-week long cohort-based training on a) planning and facilitating engaging and inclusive workshops to support participants’ success, b) knowledge of various channels through which new members can engage in and contribute to rOpenSci and R projects, and c) technical skills in software development and review. 

After training, Champions will develop their project, which can be one of these options: 

- create a new package, 
- go through the review process with an R package they already have developed, 
- or be a reviewer for our peer review system.  

Other Champions activities include options for delivering a talk, writing blog posts and teaching other community members. During this stage, Champions will receive personal and group mentorship through meetings with mentors, quarterly cohort calls, Community Manager support, and a dedicated channel on rOpenSci Slack workspace.

We will provide a $1000 (USD) stipend to the selected community champions.

You can see all details on our [Champions Program webpage](/champions/).
