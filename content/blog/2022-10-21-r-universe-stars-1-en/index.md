[Artículo en español](/blog/2022/10/21/r-universe-stars-1-es/)

This is the first post of our interview series __"Meeting the stars of the R-universe"__. We begin our journey in _Argentina_  with a team that uses R and develops R packages in the Argentinean State.


## The experience of working with R packages in the Argentine state

For the last two years, [Juan Pablo Ruiz Nicolini](https://twitter.com/TuQmano) has been leading a team with R and the R community as a significant factor in its work. Therefore, when he was invited to join the Markets and Statistics Department of the National Ministry of Sports and Tourism, headed by Matías Lammens, he face a large volume of data and the possibility of using it for multiple purposes.

{{< figure src = "TQPT.png" class = "center" width = "500" alt = "Profile photo of Juan Pablo Ruiz Nicolini and Pablo Tiscornia." caption = "__Juan Pablo Ruiz Nicolini__ - National Director of Markets and Statistics of the vicesecretary of Strategic Development of the Ministry of Tourism and Sports of the Nation. __Pablo Tiscornia__ - Coordinador de procesos - Ministerio de Deporte y Turismo de la Nación. National Markets and Statistics Division.">}}

The team is large in comparison with other similar government agencies and with permanent large-scale projects such as those developed in conjunction with INDEC (National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina).

_“There is a large amount of work and information available and when we started our review we found that there was a lot of great stuff, a lot of data, a lot of processes.(...) there was a lot of room to take advantage of all the information that was living inside the computers of the teams working in our office.”_, This is how Juan Pablo explains the challenge and the opportunity that joining this office represented. The idea was also to be able to share all the information externally and with accessible processes for different audiences.


From the beginning, the process involved several steps. First they made the decision that R packages and open source software were the way to go. Then came the internal training stage. 

[Pablo Tiscornia](https://twitter.com/pabblo_h) is part of Juan Pablo's team or _el Tucu_ -that's how Juan Pablo Ruiz Nicolini is known- and explains that the starting point of their working is use everything that the R community had been offering and the free software philosophy.  Until now the work in the office combined manual processes and almost everything was in proprietary software. Pablo and Tucu met with a team of approximately 17 people who worked in some way with data processing and who were all very involved with the processes: _“first we needed to solve an internal work dynamic (...) there was a lot to do. Today I think out of those 17 people 15, 14 all of them know how to open R, they know how to put together a script and they know how they want to be involved in the process we define. From the moment you have a piece of data until you communicate at the end.”_

At this stage, the objective was achieved: the team learn the tool and the work dynamics that they had defined as the most appropriate.

The second step was to _"open the process"_ as well as _"improve the workflow"_. Pablo explains that they also incorporated the _"dynamics of an open State, open our process, not hiding how we do our work."_. A concept that in the future will also include the possibility of receiving contributions from the community and or our code to be reviewed.

As all processes are complex and many of them involve simultaneous and even "chaotic" steps, as _Tucu_ describes, where different people with diverse knowledge contributed to the design of the projects that are currently under development.

_Tucu_ gives as an example the _Thursday meeting_ where they show and share their codes so that other people can use them in other parts of the process: _"We do live coding where we raise doubts and do exercises (...) we try to generate a dynamic in which we share in a ludic way, sometimes showing each part and what they are doing to be shared with others."_


## Free software and in our language

In addition to the free nature of open source software and the importance of resource management for a State, Pablo Tiscornia explains what appears almost as a declaration of principles: _“It is a work philosophy, and an idea about how we develop and promote knowledge. I think what we can give, today to the State, is thanks to free software. So, it would be almost irresponsible not to promote what formed us.”_

Juan Pablo reinforces the idea with his personal experience: _“I was a master's thesis student in political science and seven years ago I forced myself to do my thesis in R in order to learn (...) and what I quickly found, luckily, was the R community.”._

__Exchanging with the community and learning from the community seems to be the main mantra of the R community that both Tucu and Pablo share with the team.__


## A work for the community

The audiences that receive the work developed in the office are multiple.

{{< figure src = "sinta.png" class = "pull-left" width = "380" alt = "SINTA system home page with access to its open datasets." >}}

Today they have a site called [SINTA (Sistema de Información Turístico de la Argentina)](https://www.yvera.tur.ar/sinta/) where they present in an orderly fashion the _"different ways of accessing information"_. Juan Pablo explains that _"the work was to develop tools. R has much to do with this, bringing the information closer to different audiences"_.

Those audiences include academics (people who research and teach) and government. So, for example, different offices at different levels of the State need the data, and the office they work for that uses the information for decision-making and public policy setting. Also, all the people that want to interact with the information in the open data portal.

## The R-universe experience

The concept of community is closely related to social and communication networks, and it was precisely Twitter that first brought Juan Pablo closer to [R-universe](https://r-universe.dev/search/) where he discovered [the step-by-step on how to build his own R universe.](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/09/21/creando-tu-r-universe/).

_“El paso medio lógico en esto de estar compartiendo las cosas que estamos haciendo hacia fuera, era poder disponibilizar también a los paquetes que están en nuestro GitHub, es poder abrir nuestro pequeño mercadito (...) y R-universe sirve para compartir ahí las librerías que estamos empezando a armar”_, así explica el _Tucu_ el primer uso que le dieron a la plataforma y agrega: _“Lo que me parece espectacular, es cómo se va modificando en el tiempo, lo completo que es la manera de visualizar todo el desarrollo que uno está compartiendo en R-universe”_.
Pablo agrega que fue parte del proceso donde se presentó casi de manera lógica después de la capacitación y de la incorporación del lenguaje R a la oficina, empezar a desarrollar paquetes: _“Armamos, por un lado, las herramientas que nos mejoraban el flujo de trabajo, el paquete {herramientas}. Y por el otro, el paquete de {comunicación} donde la idea era principalmente y hoy todavía sigue siendo, mejorar el flujo de trabajo de nuestro equipo, de nuestro día a día”_.

They also add two important objectives to the whole process: to smooth the language and make it accessible to all people, even those who do not necessarily come from programming backgrounds, and to develop the packages. _“lo más en castellano posible que se pueda”_. El objetivo era el mismo: _no tener que pensar si el equipo sabe o no inglés o si el idioma se transforma en una barrera para realizar el trabajo._

{{< figure src = "dnme-r-universe.png" class = "pull-right" width = "500" alt = "r-universe profile with SINTA's packages" >}}


Both Pablo and Juan Pablo agree that the main potential of R-universe for the office is _being able to host all the packages they have under development._ Pablo defines it like this: _“El principal uso que hoy le veo a priori es ser un gran armario en donde poner todas nuestras cajas de herramientas y que incluso también podamos mostrar eso (...) que tenemos un [armario de herramientas que tienen un sentido común y que tienen una filosofía común de trabajo también](https://dnme-minturdep.r-universe.dev/ui#packages)”_.

The work of Juan Pablo and Pablo as well as that of R-universe are inscribed in a world that has changed its structures and as they define it in the talk. In Pablo's words: _“Estamos en un mundo en donde la programación ya no es de programadores en término de quien estudió para eso estamos en un mundo en donde hay muchas personas que colaboran y quieren colaborar con solo una parte o un gramo”_.

Juan Pablo concludes by saying: _“Hay más barreras que se pueden seguir bajando y sobre todo para quienes no venimos de la programación, venimos de las ciencias sociales y empezamos a programar y empezamos a usar herramientas que nos facilitaron el trabajo. Ahí hay una instancia para facilitar aún más el trabajo que podemos escribir con la filosofía tidy con su manifiesto y que además lo podemos hacer en castellano”_.
