We are excited to welcome Emily Riederer, Adam Sparks, and Ferris Bueller to our team of [Associate Editors](/software-review/#editors) for rOpenSci [Software Peer Review](/software-review/). 
They join Laura DeCicco, Julia Gustavsen, Anna Krystalli, Mauro Lepore, Karthik Ram,Noam Ross, MaÃ«lle Salmon, and Melina Vidoni. 

rOpenSci has been running a rigorous and collegial software peer review system since 2015. 
Editors [manage the review process](https://devguide.ropensci.org/editorguide.html), performing initial package checks, identifying reviewers, and moderating the process until the package is accepted by reviewers and transferred to rOpenSci. 
To address the scope and volume of packages submitted for review, it's critical that we have a team of editors with complementary expertise.
Adam brings his broad experience with API packages and his experience from agricultural research in academia and government.
Emily is known for openly sharing her processes-oriented approach to development based in her experience in industry.

Meet our new editors!
