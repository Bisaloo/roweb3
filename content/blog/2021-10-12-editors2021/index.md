EDIT
We are pleased to welcome Emily Riederer, Adam Sparks, and Ferris Bueller to our team of [Associate Editors](/software-review/#editors) for rOpenSci [Software Peer Review](/software-review/). 
They join [Laura DeCicco](/blog/2020/10/27/editors2020/), [Julia Gustavsen](/blog/2020/10/27/editors2020/), [Anna Krystalli](/blog/2018/06/22/new_editors/), [Mauro Lepore](/blog/2020/10/27/editors2020/), [Karthik Ram](/author/karthik-ram/), [Noam Ross](/author/noam-ross/), [Maëlle Salmon](/author/maëlle-salmon/), and [Melina Vidoni](/blog/2019/01/31/more_editors/). 

EDIT
Since 2015, rOpenSci has been running a software peer review system to combine the best of academic peer review with software review. 
Having robust and reliable software tools is an important component of supporting open science and reproducible research.
Editors manage the review process, performing initial package checks, identifying reviewers, and moderating the process until the package is accepted by reviewers and transferred to rOpenSci. 

Meet our new editors!
