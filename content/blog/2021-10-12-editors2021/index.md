We are excited to welcome Emily Riederer, Adam Sparks, and Ferris Bueller to our team of [Associate Editors](/software-review/#editors) for rOpenSci [Software Peer Review](/software-review/). 
They join Laura DeCicco, Julia Gustavsen, Anna Krystalli, Mauro Lepore, Karthik Ram,Noam Ross, MaÃ«lle Salmon, and Melina Vidoni. 

rOpenSci has been running a rigorous and collegial software peer review system since 2015. 
Editors [manage the review process](https://devguide.ropensci.org/editorguide.html), performing initial package checks, identifying reviewers, and moderating the process until the package is accepted by reviewers and transferred to rOpenSci. 
To address the scope and volume of packages submitted for review, it's critical that we have a team of editors with complementary expertise.
Adam brings his broad experience with API packages and his experience from agricultural research in academia and government.
Emily is known for openly sharing her processes-oriented approach to development based in her experience in industry.

Meet our new editors!

## Emily Riederer

{{< imgtxt src = "/img/team/emily-riederer.jpg" width = "200" alt = "headshot of Emily Riederer">}} 

Emily is a Senior Analytics Manager at Capital One, with degrees in Mathematics and Mathematical Decision Sciences (Statistics and Operations Research) from UNC Chapel Hill (USA). 
Emily leads a team focused on data enablement by developing "inner-source" analytical tools (including many R packages!) and designing better data structures. She enjoys sharing her thoughts on R and data on her [blog](https://emilyriederer.netlify.com/) and has contributed to two books ([R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/), [97 Things Every Data Engineer Should Know](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9781492062400/)). In her spare time, she maintains two open source R packages ([`projmgr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=projmgr) and [`convo`](https://github.com/emilyriederer/convo)) and a dbt package ([`dbtplyr`](https://github.com/emilyriederer/dbtplyr)). 
Emily reviewed the [tradestatistics](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/274) package for rOpenSci, has guest-edited the review of [dataspice](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/426) and is currently handling [cffr](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/463) for generating Citation File Format ('cff') metadata for R Packages.

> I had the great fortune of stumbling upon rOpenSci relatively early in my career as an R programmer, and it's not an exaggeration to say that this organization has had one of the single largest impacts on my career. rOpenSci's meticulous documentation helped me to embrace best practices in my development work. Perhaps even more impactful is how watching rOpenSci work shaped my perspective on community building, leadership, and teamwork. I have always admired the well-oiled machine that rOpenSci has created -- sustaining massive value with limited individual overhead by clearly defining expectations, providing opinionated infrastructure, and cultivating a phenomenal community. I'm thrilled to be taking a formal role in an organization that has had such an impact on me. 



## Adam Sparks

Adam is a Senior Research Scientist in Bioeconomic Modelling for the [State of Western Australia](https://www.dpird.wa.gov.au/) in Perth and has a PhD in epidemiology and ecology of plant pathogens from Kansas State University (USA). 
He specializes in simulation modelling and geographic information systems (GIS) and has developed or co-authored several R packages to help gather weather and climate data and study pathogen populations. Adam has been active in rOpenSci software peer review since 2016, having five packages pass review: [bomrang](https://docs.ropensci.org/bomrang); [getCRUCLdata](https://docs.ropensci.org/getCRUCLdata); [GSODR](https://docs.ropensci.org/GSODR); [nasapower](https://docs.ropensci.org/nasapower);and  [chirps](https://docs.ropensci.org/chirps/) as co-author.
Adam has reviewed two rOpenSci packages [stats19](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/266), [rnassqs](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/298), [bib2df](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/124), and guest edited the review of [allodb](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/436).
