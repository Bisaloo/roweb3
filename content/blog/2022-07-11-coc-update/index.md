description: Update on Code of Conduct 2022.

We are pleased to announce the release of _Version 2.4_ of our Code of Conduct with changes based on the feedback of our community.

### Whatâ€™s new?

- Greater detail about acceptable and unacceptable behaviors in online settings. 
- First translation of the text to Spanish.

You can access now the last version full-text in [English](/code-of-conduct/) and [Spanish](/codigo-de-conducta/). 

We welcome your feedback by email to `conduct at ropensci.org`. 

As always our Code of Conduct uses community sources to improve.  For these changes, we have consulted and adapted the [useR! 2021 Code of Conduct](https://user2021.r-project.org/participation/coc/). 


Thank you for working with us to keep rOpenSci a safe, enjoyable, friendly, and enriching experience for everyone who participates.
