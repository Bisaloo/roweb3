This is the R Markdown (.Rmd) template for a blog post or tech note. 
To generate your post with just Markdown (.md), use that template instead.

Throughout this template, including the YAML, 
you should change "post-template" to the slug of your post, 
and "2019-06-04" to your publication date.

Save this file under /content/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/index.Rmd in the local copy of your roweb2 fork.

The chunk below ensures your plots will be inserted in the same folder as your Rmd so you can submit the bundle (.Rmd, .md, images) to roweb2.



The figure paths in the resulting Markdown will already be valid so you won't need to edit the Markdown file.

## Section heading in sentence case

Citation of the primary literature[^1]. 

Citation of a website[^2]. 

Citation of an R package[^3].

### Subsection heading

We recommend the use of [Hugo shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) to include images, tweets, videos, gists, etc. In the Rmd file they need to be between `<!--html_preserve-->` and `<!--/html_preserve-->`.

**Add an image** by using a Hugo shortcode. The image is saved under `/content/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/name-of-image.png`.

<!--html_preserve-->
{{< figure src = "name-of-image.png" width = "400" alt = "this is the alternative text" >}}
<!--/html_preserve-->

Consult the Technical Guidelines for tips on changing image size, alignment, and for advice on alternative text.

Below is another image, a plot generated by a code chunk, so you might see how to add alternative text and other options in this case. You can also use [all options documented for the figure shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure) except for `src` that will be created automatically when knitting.


**Embed a tweet** by using a Hugo shortcode. 

<!--html_preserve-->
{{< tweet 1138216112808529920 >}}
<!--/html_preserve-->


**Tweak code highlighting** Below you can see how to use Hugo [Chroma code highlighting options](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlight-shortcode): highlight the 1st and 4th to 6th code lines, number lines as a table starting from 199.

```r {linenos=table,hl_lines=[1,"4-6"],linenostart=199}
a <- 1
a <- 1
a <- 1
a <- 1
a <- 1
a <- 1
a <- 1
```

**Add citation or footnote** text by using the format below

# Background
[medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/) is the preprint repository for papers in the medical, clinical, and related health sciences, has become a central source of new information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and is a key source of new studies related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, more and more evidence synthesists have begun to include it in the list of databases they search as part of a systematic review.

However, the search functionality available on the medRxiv website is not suitable for use in a systematic review, due to a number of limitations. Additionally, the lack of a full 

TL:DR: Be careful when searching medRxiv for systematic reviews!

# Issues
### Limiting to specific fields

Say you are looking for records related to dementia, but want to limit your search to the title and abstract fields.
You got to "Advanced search", enter dementia into the title and abstract box, and hit enter. This returns 419 records, and helpfully tells you that you have limited to the title and abstract fields. 


However, problems arise when you look at what is actually being returned by your search. If you filter by "Oldest first" (see screenshot below), and examine the top record ("Perception of whole-body motion during balance perturbations is impaired in Parkinson's disease and is associated with balance impairment"), you'll find that the term "dementia" does not appear anywhere in its title or abstract. 

If you go further, and have a look at the full text of the article (click [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000265v1.full.pdf) to view the full text PDF for this record), you'll find that the only place the term "dementia" occurs in this record is *__in the title of one of the references__*.


But it gets worse. 

If you run the exact same search but with no field limits, 425 results are returned, i.e. 6 more than if you run a search limiting to title/abstract (see screenshot, below). On the basis of the example above, searching by title/abstract doesn't actually limit the search to these fields, but instead searches the whole record. So why is there any discrepancy between the two searches? What's happened to these 6 records?

### Retrieving irrelevant records

Say you are interested in finding papers that include the term "lipids". You run your search, this time ordering by "Newest first". The first two records, on investigation of the full text PDF, are found to contain the terms "lipids". Howver, the third record, titled "The Relationship between the Global Burden of Influenza from 2017-2019 and COVID-19", does not. Why is this article being returned by the search?

### Using Boolean operators

An additional problem comes from the use of Boolean operators in search strings. Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) are used by information specialists to combine individual search terms into specific complex search strings. For example, "(dementia OR alzheimer)" would be expected to return any record containing either "dementia" or "alzheimer". Combining this with a second topic via AND, e.g. "(dementia OR alzheimer) AND (lipid)", should return any record containing either "dementia" or "alzheimer", once it also contains the term "lipid".

One important thing to note is that, due to the lack of documentation on the medRxiv website's search functionality, it is not clear whether Boolean operators are allowed. However, when asked about it on Twitter, Richard Server, Assistant Director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press which is responsible for the medRxiv and bioRxiv repositories, seemed to indicate that they are supported:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">thanks for letting us know - will look into it</p>&mdash; Richard Sever â“Š (@cshperspectives) <a href="https://twitter.com/cshperspectives/status/1257439037423587333?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 4, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

However, on the basis that the current search does allow for Boolean operators, then they do not work as expected. One of the key assumptions is that the order of the terms does not matter, i.e. that "(dementia OR alzheimer)" is equivalent to "(alzheimer OR dementia)". However, some example searches show this is not the case:




It's not clear what is happening, but there is potentially some weighting of terms based on proximity. This means that key records may be missed based on the arbitrary ordering of the terms.

# And another thing . . .

As a small aside, any systematic reviewer will tell you that for a database to be useful as an information source, the one thing it **needs** to have is an option to export the results of a given search en masse.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">anyone have a method for bulk export from medRxiv? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/systematicreviews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#systematicreviews</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rapidreviews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rapidreviews</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ukmedlibs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ukmedlibs</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/medlibs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#medlibs</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/thanks?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#thanks</a></p>&mdash; (((MarshallDozier))) (@mafrado) <a href="https://twitter.com/mafrado/status/1244905414019428353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 31, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<br>

Unfortunately, medRxiv does not yet have a bulk download option. This means that records must be exported by hand in small batches, an error-prone and time-consuming (not to mention anger-inducing) method of extracting citations from a bibliographic database.

# `medRxivr`

medRxiv is a fantastic resource and has been a key source of information related to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the issues above mean that the websites search precludes it from use in is not suitable for use in 

Taken together, these limitations are what prompted the development of the medRxivr R package and Shiny web-app.

These limitations are what prompted us (myself and Lena Schmidt) to create `medrxivr`, a [R package](https://mcguinlu.github.io/medrxivr/index.html) and [web application](https://mcguinlu.shinyapps.io/medrxivr/) that provides a transparent and reproducible way to search the medRxiv preprint repository.
