## A mentoring & training program for Scientific Open Source Champions

Research software _should serve everyone in our communities_, which means it needs to be _sustainable, open, and built by and for all groups_. Currently, however, there is a dismaying lack of diversity in open source communities in general and the R / research software community in particular. Developers in the R community are overwhelmingly white, male, and from a handful of countries. That lack of diversity is potentially detrimental to the sustainability, utility and productivity of projects. 

The rOpenSci Champions program is for __people from historically and systematically excluded groups__ who are interested in contributing to rOpenSci and the broader open source and open science communities.

## Eligability

We are looking for people, from anywhere in the world, who identify with the above and who

* already have development knowledge with the R language and a solid idea for an R package they’d like to develop, or

* have already developed an R package, and want to have it peer reviewed through rOpenSci

* have basic English communication skills


## About the program

This is a _12-month-long cohort-based training and personal mentorship program_. Champions will participate in:

* A 6-week long cohort-based training on:

  - how to plan and facilitate engaging and inclusive workshops to support participants’ success,
  
  - knowledge of various channels through which new members can engage in and contribute to rOpenSci and R projects, and
  
  - technical skills in software development and review.

* Personal and group mentorship:

  - A series of meetings with mentors

  - Quarterly cohort calls

See [the program time line for more detail](#Program-timeline)


## What are the benefits of taking part? 

By participating in this program, you can help rOpenSci and _your community grow_. In addition to _training and personal mentoring_, some other benefits you will receive are:

  * Learn and practice organizing and teaching workshops 
  
  * Learn and practice reviewer, and developer skills.
  
  * Gain transferable skills and experiences that are sought after for careers in open source software.
  
  * Become an active contributing member of the rOpenSci community.
  
  * Collaborate with others in Open Research Software projects.
  
  * Empower members of your community by sharing what you learn.
  
  * Create content in the language of your community.
  
  * Gain insights from other experts and increase your contact network.
  
  * Gain visibility through training, mentorship, and content creation.
  
  * Get recognition and acknowledgment for your work.
  
  * Co-develop this program and other rOpenSci projects by sharing feedback.
  
  * Become a mentor to other members of your community


We will provide a _$1000 (USD) stipend_ to the selected community champions.



## Program expectations (Commitment of the Champions)

Champions are committed to completing training and attending meetings with their mentors and cohorts. After training, champions will develop their project: _build a new package, take over an R package maintenance or go through the peer review process_.

Champions will also choose and perform several activities from a set, such as running recruitment activities, giving presentations, write blog post, and organizing peer groups in their communities.

It is expected that champions will promote participation in peer review and contribution to rOpenSci open source software, infrastructure, and documentation. They will also gather feedback on where rOpenSci’s current programming might be improved to meet the needs of all who wish to participate.

The estimated time commitment for each Champion is, on average, _10 hours per month_ (includes trainings, cohort events, mentoring meetings, package development or review process, and preparing for and hosting champions events). The total time commitment for each Champion will vary based on the path and activities they choose to do during the program.
